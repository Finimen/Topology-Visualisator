# Topology-Visualisator
This is a project that will help developers in creating application architecture.

Thanks to the visualization of architecture, it will be easier for you to think through it, to notice various points.

The application itself will provide 2 modes of operation. 
First, this is a draft: this is where you will sketch out the architecture, mostly before building the application. 
It will also be possible to immediately import all classes/interfaces into a c# project to quickly create a framework. The second is importing a finished project. 
This mode will be needed for large projects with complex architecture, or to solve problematic issues in an already created project.

Here is the source code for the application, but it is not intended for redistribution.
